## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the foodie-API, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

### 2. Report the vulnerability
Email your findings to: [security@yourdomain.com]

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### 3. Response timeline
- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (depending on severity)

## Security Measures

### CodeQL Analysis
This project uses GitHub's CodeQL for automated security analysis:

- **Automated scanning**: Runs on every push and pull request
- **Custom queries**: Tailored for foodie-API security patterns
- **Weekly scans**: Scheduled analysis every Monday
- **Security alerts**: Automatic notifications for new vulnerabilities

### Security Focus Areas

#### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token validation
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Authorization middleware checks
- User access control

#### 2. Database Security
- SQL injection prevention
- Raw query parameterization
- Input validation before database operations
- Error handling in database queries

#### 3. Input Validation
- Request body validation with Joi
- Path parameter sanitization
- Query parameter validation
- Type checking and bounds validation

#### 4. Error Handling
- Sensitive information protection
- Proper error response formatting
- Secure logging practices
- Stack trace protection

### Security Best Practices

#### For Developers
1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input
2. **Authentication**: Use proper JWT validation and bcrypt for passwords
3. **Database**: Use parameterized queries, never concatenate SQL
4. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
5. **Logging**: Avoid logging sensitive data like passwords or tokens

#### For Contributors
1. **Code Review**: Security-focused code reviews
2. **Testing**: Include security tests in your changes
3. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated
4. **Documentation**: Document security-related changes
